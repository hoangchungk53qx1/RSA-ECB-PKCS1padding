# RSA-ECB-PKCS1padding
RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding Encryption and Decryption in SwiftRSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding cryptography encryption and decryption in Swift.
We will be generating keys pairs( public and private keys) using OpenSSL and use these keys for asymmetric encryption and decryption.
Even you have another option to generate keys online.

I created this project to modify and test the rsa/ecb/pkcs1padding algorithm for different encryption and decryption purposes, a class that allows you to create digitally signed apps or crypto apps
give me a star if you find it useful
